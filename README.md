# edge-recognition-project-using-python-
Edge detection is an image processing technique for finding the boundaries of objects within images. It works by detecting discontinuities in brightness. Edge detection is used for image segmentation and data extraction in areas such as image processing, computer vision, and machine vision.

To implement this application we have used open cv and numpy with python .It is a very common concept while using filters in snapchat and other social media networking sites .
The demonstration for same has been attached in the video along with the other functions and files used .
